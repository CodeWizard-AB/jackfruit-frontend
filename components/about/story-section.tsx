							JackFruit was born from a simple observation: businesses were
							drowning in complexity while the solutions they needed remained
							frustratingly out of reach.
						</p>
						<p>
							We set out to change that. By combining cutting-edge AI technology
							with human-centered design, we create software that doesn&apos;t just
							workâ€”it transforms.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, we partner with forward-thinking companies to build the
							intelligent systems that power tomorrow&apos;s success stories.
